My final project idea:
For my final project I will create a biencoder CNN in R. This will be an R version
of a python one that I am making for the research I am doing with you. It will 
have the goal of detecting ecological processes at play in mircobial communties
through analysis of before and after of resident comuunites being introduced
a donor community.

Data:
The data for this will be proportions of microbial communities that are transformed 
through DeepInsight into images that can then be processed by the CNN. 
You can find example data of resident community matices, donor intial matrices 
and then resultant donor communties. An example graph of what this might look like
is bar graph where the output of the CNN (7 outputs) will graph the decimal 
numbers that are predicted on each bar graph. I will include a sample graph that shows sample
output.
